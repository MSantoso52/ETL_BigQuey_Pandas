# ETL_BigQuey_Pandas
Building an ETL Pipeline for CO2 Emission Data Analysis Using BigQuery and Python

# *Overview*
To design and implement ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines to ingest data from external sources, process it, and store it in a data warehouse for analysis. This simulates a real-world data engineering workflow, where you handle data ingestion, ensure data quality, and enable downstream analytics. The project uses Python for scripting and the google-cloud-bigquery library to interact with BigQuery.
* Extracts data from external source (CSV file)
* Transforms the data (e.g., cleaning, aggregating, converting units).
* Loads the processed data into Google BigQuery for storage and querying.
